This mod stops your pawns from being able to repair buildings, apparel and weapons that they do not know how to build in the first place. 
Basically anything that has not been researched can be used but not repaired.
Always found it strange that my colony of tribals could scavenge a solar panel or a sniper rifle and keep it in working order.

Its compatible with the following mods:

If I've missed any repair-mod, please leave a comment below and I'll try to add support for it.

There is also a setting to block repair based on colony tech-level.
